Update LOG scAPAtrap v0.2.0:
# Fix a bug in findPeaks: previously, when no peaks wider than maxwidth, will not output small peaks.
# Add function findPeaksByStrand, which combines previous loadBpCoverages and findPeaks.
# Add wrapper function scAPAtrap for one step running.
# Add initScAPAtrap and demo script for step by step run of scAPAtrap.
# Add neat LOG and message.
# Add function findTails (genome-wide searching) and findTailsByPeaks (peaks-wide searching) to find tails independently.
# Add function reducePeaks to remove lowly expressed peaks, which can be called before searching tails or output.
# Add function convertAPAtrapData to convert scAPAtrapData (a list) to other objects incuding PACdataset, SeurateObject, SingleCellExperiment.
# Update function generatescExpMa to allow tail=NULL for not searching tails of peaks; output a list containing sparseMatrix for bigger data.
# More flexible parameter settings (TRAP.PARAMS): allowing flexible chrs, barcode, tails.
# Add global variable TRAPFILES to record output files in scAPAtrap.
# Add vignette <movAPA_on_scAPAtrap_results> and <scAPAtrap_tutorial>.
